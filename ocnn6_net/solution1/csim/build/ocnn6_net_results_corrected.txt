8-Layer OCNN6 Results (CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE)
=============================================
Input: 64³ voxels, 3 channels (13105 occupied, 4.99916% sparse)
Output: 64³ voxels, 40 classes (with zeros restored)
Architecture: Persistent BRAM + Pruned DRAM + Access Pointers
Total processed pruned voxels: 0
Non-zero outputs: 320
Output range: [0, 0.01]
Best prediction: Class 0 (score=0.01)
Pipeline status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Network Architecture:
- 6 Convolutional layers (3D convolutions with stride=2)
- 2 Fully connected layers (512->128->40)
- Cross-row sorting for layers with spatial dim <= 8
- ReLU activation (except final layer)

Key Innovations Used:
- ONE-TIME bitmap construction before Layer 1
- Persistent BRAM octree across all 8 layers
- Access pointer mechanism for all layers
- 2-level memory hierarchy (3-Z buffer + pruned DRAM)
- Cross-row sorting for small dimensions
- Logical bitmap reconstruction (BRAM reads only)
- Final output reconstruction with zeros restored
