14-Layer MinkowskiNet Results (CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE)
=====================================================
Input: 64³ voxels, 3 channels (13105 occupied, 4.99916% sparse)
Output: 64³ voxels, 20 classes (with zeros restored)
Architecture: Persistent BRAM + Pruned DRAM + Access Pointers
Total processed pruned voxels: 25
Non-zero outputs: 140
Output range: [0, 0.0235788]
Best prediction: Class 3 (score=0.0235788)
Pipeline status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Key Innovations Used:
- ONE-TIME bitmap construction before Layer 1
- Persistent BRAM octree across all 14 layers
- Access pointer mechanism for all layers
- 2-level memory hierarchy (3-Z buffer + pruned DRAM)
- Cross-row sorting for small dimensions
- Logical bitmap reconstruction (BRAM reads only)
- Final output reconstruction with zeros restored
